Project Flow

Installation of Contiki-ng
We have installed contiki-ng on a vmware virtual machine.Later we created a sensor as per our
project requirement.

Sensor setup
We created 3 virtual networks of sensors and connected them to the rpl border router. Each sensor
generates values of ph,temperature,humidity and light intensity. Those values are accumulated at
border router which acts as a connectivity level between physical devices and cloud part. In the im-
plementation border router is used to to send and receive messages so border router is implemented.
(Refer Contiki sensor code for clear understanding)


Border router connection storage
Whenever we have given appropriate ip address of sensors, those generated values are being displayed.
It specifies that border router is connected to the internet. Now along with printing the values we
can save those values in a text file by leveraging the functionality of c programming language. So
whenever the value is being displayed, it is automatically stored in the text file.

Convertion of text file to csv file
For the data analytics part, we can convert generated text file into csv file which contains comma
separated values of different sensor values. Now the generated csv file is stored in cloud fo further
analysis.

Data Analytics
Based on data generated by the sensors(which is stored in csv file), we have implemented several
tasks related to data analytics.
They are 
1)Smart Irrigations System
2)Crop Recommendation system
3)Data Generation
4)Analysis and visualization
(Refer the related python codes for each module implementation)
